to add your stuff to the website, all you need to do is upload all your code into this folder.

if you need to change the names of folders, make sure you update it in the "index.php" file.
example: currently, in index.php it points to "/capstone/tmdb/search-options.php" which brings you to my page with all the stuff i made for my end of the project.
